## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: BUILD-phase eligibility
The NPC builder SHALL place blocks only while the game result is IN_PROGRESS and the current phase is BUILD.

#### Scenario: Place during an active BUILD phase
- **WHEN** the game is in progress, the phase is BUILD, and the current round has placements remaining
- **THEN** one builder update creates one block

#### Scenario: Ignore ATTACK-phase updates
- **WHEN** the current phase is ATTACK
- **THEN** a builder update creates no blocks

#### Scenario: Ignore updates after game completion
- **WHEN** the game result is WIN or LOSS
- **THEN** a builder update creates no blocks

### Requirement: Per-round placement quota
The NPC builder SHALL place exactly eight new blocks per round and SHALL place at most one block per update.

#### Scenario: Incremental construction
- **WHEN** an active BUILD phase has eight placements remaining
- **THEN** eight consecutive builder updates create one new block each

#### Scenario: No premature completion
- **WHEN** fewer than eight blocks have been placed for the current round
- **THEN** the phase remains BUILD

### Requirement: Mascot-relative placement priority
The NPC builder SHALL place blocks on the mascot's XZ grid plane, preserve the mascot's Y coordinate, define positive Z as front, and search deterministic concentric rings from the mascot outward.

Within each ring, the builder SHALL prioritize front center, left and right centers, the remaining front edge in symmetric pairs, the remaining side edges from front to rear in symmetric pairs, and the remaining rear edge ending at rear center.

#### Scenario: First-ring placement order
- **WHEN** the mascot is at `(0, 0, 0)` and the first ring is unoccupied
- **THEN** the first eight positions are `(0, 0, 1)`, `(-1, 0, 0)`, `(1, 0, 0)`, `(-1, 0, 1)`, `(1, 0, 1)`, `(-1, 0, -1)`, `(1, 0, -1)`, and `(0, 0, -1)` in that order

#### Scenario: Translate positions from the mascot
- **WHEN** the mascot is at a non-origin grid position
- **THEN** every generated offset is added to the mascot position and every placed block uses the mascot's Y coordinate

### Requirement: Occupied-position handling and survivor persistence
The NPC builder SHALL treat positions containing an existing block as occupied, SHALL skip occupied candidate positions, and SHALL leave all existing blocks unchanged.

#### Scenario: Skip a priority position
- **WHEN** the highest-priority candidate position already contains a block
- **THEN** the next new block is placed at the first unoccupied candidate position

#### Scenario: Preserve surviving defenses
- **WHEN** a new BUILD phase starts with blocks surviving from an earlier round
- **THEN** the surviving entities retain their type, durability, and position while eight additional blocks are placed in unoccupied positions

#### Scenario: Refill a destroyed priority position
- **WHEN** a previously occupied high-priority position is empty at the start of a later BUILD phase
- **THEN** that position is selected before lower-priority free positions

### Requirement: Round-specific block composition
The NPC builder SHALL use the successful placement index to repeat the ordered block script assigned to the current round.

The scripts SHALL be SAND for round 1, SAND then CORAL for round 2, ROCK then SHELL for round 3, and ROCK then JELLYFISH for round 4.

#### Scenario: Round 1 composition
- **WHEN** the builder completes round 1 construction
- **THEN** all eight newly placed blocks are SAND

#### Scenario: Round 2 composition
- **WHEN** the builder completes round 2 construction
- **THEN** the eight newly placed block types alternate SAND and CORAL, starting with SAND

#### Scenario: Round 3 composition
- **WHEN** the builder completes round 3 construction
- **THEN** the eight newly placed block types alternate ROCK and SHELL, starting with ROCK

#### Scenario: Round 4 composition
- **WHEN** the builder completes round 4 construction
- **THEN** the eight newly placed block types alternate ROCK and JELLYFISH, starting with ROCK

### Requirement: Complete block entity state
Each NPC placement SHALL create a block entity with `PositionComponent`, a full-health `BlockComponent` of the scripted type, and a stable type-derived `ModelComponent`.

#### Scenario: Create a usable block entity
- **WHEN** the builder places a ROCK block
- **THEN** the new entity has the selected grid position, ROCK current and maximum durability of 4, and the ROCK model identifier

### Requirement: BUILD completion signaling
After the eighth successful placement in a round, the NPC builder SHALL trigger the existing round transition to ATTACK, including resetting the attack timer to its full duration.

#### Scenario: Complete construction
- **WHEN** the builder creates the eighth block for the current round
- **THEN** the phase becomes ATTACK and the attack timer equals 60 seconds

#### Scenario: Remain inactive after completion
- **WHEN** construction has transitioned the current round to ATTACK
- **THEN** subsequent builder updates create no additional blocks
